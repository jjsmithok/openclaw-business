# FAQ - OpenClaw Setup Service

## General

**What is OpenClaw?**
OpenClaw is a self-hosted AI agent that connects to messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord) and performs real tasks — managing emails, calendars, browser automation, and more.

**Why would I need help setting it up?**
While OpenClaw is powerful, non-technical users face hurdles: installing dependencies, configuring messaging integrations, securing the agent, and keeping it running 24/7. We handle all of that.

**Is my data safe?**
Yes. OpenClaw runs on your own VPS — your data never touches our servers. We set up isolated environments with security hardening (firewalls, fail2ban, automatic backups).
