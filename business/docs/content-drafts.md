## Tweet 1: VPS Guide (Post Today)

Top 3 VPS for running OpenClaw (even if you're not technical):

1. @DigitalOcean - Easiest UI, great docs
2. @Hetzner_Online - Best price/performance
3. @Hostinger - Cheapest starter

Pro tip: Avoid shared hosting. OpenClaw needs its own environment.

## Tweet 2: Common Issues
```
Most common OpenClaw setup issues I see:

🔧 Port forwarding headaches
🔧 API key confusion  
🔧 Messaging app auth problems
🔧 Security misconfigurations

I built a service to handle this for you. First 5 beta spots at $149 (normally $500).

Hey [Name], saw your post about [pain point]. 

I help non-technical users set up OpenClaw securely — handles all the config, security hardening, and gets it running 24/7.

Currently running a beta special: $149 setup (first 5 spots) + free first month hosting.

## Tweet 3: Security Focus
```
Privacy concern with AI agents?

OpenClaw is self-hosted — your data never touches third-party servers.

I offer fully hardened setups:
- Isolated environments
- Firewall + fail2ban
- Automatic backups
- Zero data access for me
