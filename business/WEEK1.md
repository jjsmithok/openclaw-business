## Day 1 Still Needed ⚠️

### Blockers:
1. **Brave API key** - Provided but not persisting (gateway auth issue)
2. **Browser not connected** - Can't search manually
3. **VPS for admin OpenClaw** - Need to provision central instance
4. **X account access** - Need to post content

### What I Can Do Now:
- Refine landing page further
- Create more content drafts
- Set up Stripe payment links
- Draft customer onboarding emails

## Need From You

1. **Run `openclaw --profile acpro configure --section web`** to set up Brave Search API (free)

2. **Provide X handle** - I can help craft posts but you need to post

3. **VPS provision** - For the central admin OpenClaw, you'll need to spin up a $10/mo VPS (DigitalOcean recommended)

4. **Stripe account** - Create at stripe.com for payment links

What's your X handle? And shall I draft the Stripe payment link setup?
